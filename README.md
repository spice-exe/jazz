a sweet little script that was first written to replicate my old (like a year maybe lol) xps 13's keyboard, where dell had the genius (not joking) idea of putting the home/end/pgup/pgdown keys as 'fn' keys on the arrows. also, it had the best feeling keyboard I've ever used. I miss it.

## hotkeys

movement:
	ctrl + up = page up
	ctrl + down = page down
	ctrl + left = home
	ctrl + right = end

selection:
	ctrl + shift + up = shift + pg up
	ctrl + shift + down = shift + pg down
	ctrl + shift + left = shift + home
	ctrl + shift + right = shift + end

utility:
	~d = current date, YYYY-MM-DD, 2017-08-31
	~t = current time, HH:MM:SS, 24 hr, 05:26:57
